                            We have designed, developed, and tested an Immersive virtual reality (VR) platform to
                            practice the protocols of Self-attachment psychotherapy. We made use of customized
                            photorealistic avatars for the implementation of both the high-end version (based on
                            Facebook's Oculus) and the low-end version (based on Google's cardboard) of our platform.
                            Under the Self-attachment therapeutic framework, the causes of mental disorders such as
                            chronic anxiety and depression are traced back to the individual's insecure attachment with
                            their primary caregiver during childhood and their subsequent problems in affect regulation.
                            The conventional approach (without VR) to Self-attachment requires that the individual uses
                            their childhood photographs to recall their childhood memories and then imagine that the
                            child that they were is present with them. They thus establish a compassionate relationship
                            with their childhood self and then, using love songs and dancing, create an affectional bond
                            with them. Their adult self subsequently role plays a good parent and interacts with their
                            imagined childhood self to perform various developmental and re-parenting activities to earn
                            secure attachment. Our immersive virtual reality platform enables the users to interact with
                            their customized 3D photorealistic childhood avatar in the VR. The platform takes advantage
                            of the itSeez3D Avatar SDK for generating a customized photorealistic 3D avatar head from a
                            2D childhood image of the user. Furthermore, it allows modifications to the avatar body
                            (height/ width) and clothing color. A study to compare the use of the avatar based approach
                            (VR) to Self-attachment with the conventional photo based approach showed promising results;
                            85% of the participants reported that their photorealistic childhood avatar in VR was more
                            relatable than their childhood photo.</p>

                            Virtual Reality (VR) is the state-of-the-art human-computer interface; it uses computer
                            graphics to create a realistic-looking virtual world that the user can interact with in
                            real-time. Recent advances in VR have shown promise in the pursuit of devising new
                            techniques to combat mental disorder(s). Harnessing the power of VR, we have developed a
                            customiseds immersive virtual reality platform to practise protocols of selfattachment
                            psychotherapy. Consumer-level VR is a recent phenomenon; for wide scale adaptation of such
                            platforms it is important that they are built taking into account usability engineering
                            principles specific to virtual environments (VE). In this work, we share our experience
                            applying systematic heuristic and formative evaluations to our VR platform to make it more
                            usable. The participants who evaluated our platform were asked (via a follow-up
                            questionnaire) to rate their level-of-immersion, learn-ability and overall usability of the
                            platform. Insights from our usability evaluation could help developers build better and more
                            usable psycho-therapeutic VR platforms in the future.</p>

                            Psychotherapy is among the most effective techniques for combating mental health issues, and
                            Virtual Reality is beginning to be explored as a way to enhance the efficacy of various
                            psychotherapeutic treatments. In this work, we propose an Immersive Virtual Reality platform
                            for Self-Attachment psychotherapy. Under the Self-Attachment therapeutic framework, the
                            causes of disorders such as chronic anxiety and depression are traced back to the quality of
                            the individual's attachment with their primary caregiver during childhood. Our proposed
                            platform aims to assist the user in enhancing their capacities for self-regulation of
                            emotion, by means of earning secure attachment through the experience of positive attachment
                            interactions, missed in their childhood. In the virtual environment provided by the
                            platform, the adult-self of the user learns to create and strengthen an affectional and
                            supportive bond with the inner-child. It is hypothesised that by long term potentiation and
                            neuroplasticity, the user gradually develops new neural pathways and matures into an
                            effective secure attachment object for the inner-child, thereby enabling the self-regulation
                            of emotions.</p>

                            Rescue Base Station (RBS) is a drop-in, solar power compatible, open-source GSM
                            communication system for scenarios where a large-scale calamity disrupts traditional modes
                            of communication. The system operates using asynchronously connected autonomous nodes and
                            gathers useful information from users, eventually synchronizing this data across the network
                            using distributed network protocols. It connects people through conventional GSM services
                            allowing calls, SMS and smart phone features when available. The networks also provides a
                            series of services for use during a disaster, such as intelligent call routing, attribute
                            based search on different characteristics (name, occupation and blood group), voice-mail
                            services, SMS broadcast alerts, and emergency short-codes, through which a victim can
                            contact available doctors, fire fighters, police and rescue workers.</p>

                            SpeakMyText is an android app which enables reading-illiterates understand written text. It
                            automatically registers users without requiring any signup/login. It provides a 2-click
                            interface to let its users upload images of the documents, forms, newspaper etc. There is
                            also an interface for the volunteer translators to view the uploaded images and
                            simultaneously submit their audio recordings, which are then played back to the users. The
                            app requires an internet connection; however, it has been tested to work responsively on a
                            2.5G GPRS connection.To learn more, download the app from google playstore.</p>
